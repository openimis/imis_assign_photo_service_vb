# openIMIS - IMIS Assign Photo Windows Service

The openIMIS IMIS Assign Photo Windows Service is a service which is executed 
periodically and associates the photos sent by the mobile apps through FTP to the 
corresponding insurees.
It is built as Windows service, running in the background. 

## Getting Started
